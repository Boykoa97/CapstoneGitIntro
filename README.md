# CapstoneGitIntro
This is just to show a basic understanding of how git works

What this project will do is each branch will implement a different sorting 
algorithm and where they will be merged into the master branch. The master
branch will allow the user to any of these sorts.

My video for this is just uploaded to the repo due to only being able to submit a link on canvas. I don't have a school youtube or anything and thus have no other way of giving you the video. So if you wish to view it, you will have to do so by downloading it.

note all test arrays will use integers for simplicity
