# CapstoneGitIntro
This is just to show a basic understanding of how git works

What this project will do is each branch will implement a different sorting 
algorithm and where they will be merged into the master branch. The master
branch will allow the user to any of these sorts.

note all test arrays will use integers for simplicity
